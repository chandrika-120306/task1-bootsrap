🔹 Use of AI Tools (Transparency)

I used ChatGPT as a learning and guidance tool throughout this project.

How I used ChatGPT:

To understand where and how to place Bootstrap components correctly inside HTML structure.

To get step-by-step explanations for building sections like the hero, cards, and forms.

To clarify GitHub Pages deployment and GitHub Desktop workflow.

To help structure custom CSS without breaking Bootstrap.

To understand best practices for project reflection and documentation.


How I did NOT use ChatGPT:

I did not blindly copy full example pages.

I reviewed and understood every piece of code before using it.

I manually edited, customized, and tested all pages.


ChatGPT was used as a supportive guide and mentor, not as a replacement for learning.
